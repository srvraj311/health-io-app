This ia a react-native app for my personal project health-io, which is a healthcare automation platform.

Health.io leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to automate core healthcare functionalities, aiming to improve efficiency and streamline processes across the healthcare ecosystem. This includes utilizing AI for digital prescription generation, intelligent medication recommendations, and enhanced patient and provider experiences. Additionally, Health.io incorporates AI-powered hospital account management to optimize administrative tasks and financial processes.

### Local Setup

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

#### Step 1: Start the Metro Server
To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of this React Native project:
```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

#### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
